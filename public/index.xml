      <description>My name is William, and I am a versatile full-stack developer.
I specialize in building data-centric Python applications (ETL Systems, web crawlers), but I also have worked on multiple Golang and Node.js projects.
I also have some experience in machine learning, natural language processing, and computer vision, as well as in designing and implementing complex distributed intelligent systems, such as a cloud-based facial recognition application or a flexible recommender system.</description>
