      <description>My name is William, and I am a versatile full-stack developer.
I specialize in building data-centric Python applications (ETL Systems, web crawlers), but I also have worked on multiple Golang and Node.js projects.
I also have a strong interest in machine learning, natural language processing, and computer vision, and will most likely publish some experiments related to these in the future.</description>
