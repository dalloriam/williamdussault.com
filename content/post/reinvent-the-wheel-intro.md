In my experience, most of the short-form literature aimed at software developers falls in two broad categories.

First, you have your various technical blog posts.

These articles teach people how to do a very specific thing -- like implementing a linked list in C++ -- or to quickly get acquainted with new technologies, like how to build a Vue application with TypeScript.
This type of blog post is invaluable to broaden our horizons as developers but do little in the way of actually helping us to become proficient in a given sector.

At the complete opposite end of the spectrum, you find the research papers (and the blog posts summarizing them). These works are _extremely_ important to communicate advancements to the state of the art but can be a bit opaque for developers trying to get into a new field.

The main problem I see with these two kinds of publications is that they don't meet in the middle. You can easily find articles that will teach you how to write a "TensorFlow Hello World" in 25 minutes. There are also plenty of articles covering the theory and experimentation behind "You Only Look Once: Unified, Real-Time Object Detection", but very few publications cover the subject of actually building such a system in an approachable way.

To address that problem, I propose what could become a new series of articles: Re-Inventing the Wheel for Fun & Profit. Articles in this series will cover the design and implementation of complex systems (think databases, search engines, etc.) while assuming nothing except familiarity with the selected programming language. They will start with a naive implementation of the target system, and they will progressively teach the reader how to overcome the limitations of this simple implementation up to the point where the application is fit for production use.

I already have a few subjects in mind for this new series, starting with "How to write an efficient keyword search engine", but I'd like to hear what you would like to see. Feel free to hit me up with ideas by [email](mailto:william.dussault@hey.com)  or on twitter at [@WilliamDussault](https://twitter.com/@WilliamDussault).

That's it for now - until next time!
