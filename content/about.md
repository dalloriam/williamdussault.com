My name is William, and I am a versatile full-stack developer and (sometimes) music producer.

I specialize in building data-centric **Python** applications (ETL Systems, web crawlers), but I also have worked on multiple **Golang** and **Node.js** projects.

I also have a strong interest in **machine learning**, **natural language processing**, and **computer vision**, and will most likely publish some experiments related to these in the future.
