My name is William, and I am a software developer and (sometimes) music producer based in Quebec City.

I specialize in building performance-sensitive applications, mostly in C++ and in Rust, although I also dabble in Python and in Go.

During the day, I work at [Coveo](https://coveo.com), building state-of-the-art insight & search technologies.
