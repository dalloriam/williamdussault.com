My name is William, and I am a versatile full-stack developer.

I specialize in building data-centric **Python** applications (ETL Systems, web crawlers), but I also have worked on multiple **Golang** and **Node.js** projects.

I also have some experience in **machine learning**, **natural language processing**, and **computer vision**, as well as in designing and implementing complex distributed intelligent systems, such as a cloud-based facial recognition application or a flexible recommender system.
